# Math-Linked-List-Program
This program reads in various computations consisting of 2 numbers of an unknown length of digits, followed by an operator defining what math operation to perform.  The results for each calculation are written to the output.txt as theyâ€™re computed. This means that output.txt should be opened only once and remain open until all results have been obtained and saved to the file. 


Function prototype / Description
---------------------------------
digit * loadNumber(ifstream & file);
Is called twice for each computation (once for each large number in the file). Returns a pointer to the first element in the linked list. Uses the new operator to create each element in the list.

char getOperator(ifstream & file);
Returns the char version of the + or - operators to indicate the desired operation.
void writeNumber(digit * num, ofstream & file);
Writes the resulting number to the file. Should be passed the head pointer of that number.

void deleteNumber(digit * num);
Is called for each number created dynamically when no longer needed. Calls the delete operator on each node in the list to protect against a memory leak.

digit * addNumbers(digit * left, digit * right);
Adds the left and right operands. Returns a pointer to the first element of the result in a newly-created linked list. Creates each element in the list using the new operator. The right operand is the second number in the input file.

digit * subNumbers(digit * left, digit * right);
Subtracts the right operand from the left and returns a pointer to the first element of the result in a newly-created linked list. Creates each element in the list using the new operator. The right operand is the second number in the input file.
